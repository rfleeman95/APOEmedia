# APOEmedia

A [workflowr][] project.

[workflowr]: https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr

This project is from the luminex I ran on September 3, 2020 with cell culture media from APOE3 and APOE4 primary astrocyte and neuron cultures.
Cultures were stimulated with 
a) heterogeneous a-beta diluted in astrocytic media OR neuronal media
b) astrocytic conditioned media (from astrocytes which had been treated with a-beta)
c) heterogeneous a-beta diluted in 50/50 astrocytic and neuronal media
