This project is from the luminex Rebecca Fleeman ran on September 3, 2020 with cell culture media from APOE3 and APOE4 primary astrocyte and neuron cultures.
Cultures were stimulated with 
a) heterogeneous a-beta diluted in astrocytic media OR neuronal media
b) astrocytic conditioned media (from astrocytes which had been treated with a-beta)
c) heterogeneous a-beta diluted in 50/50 astrocytic and neuronal media
